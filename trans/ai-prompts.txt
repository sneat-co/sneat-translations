Run test TestTRANS from file "translations_test.go"
and add all missing translations  reported by the test (escape all Unicode formatting characters)
to var TRANS only in the file "trans/translations.go"

The locales keys in TRANS should be sorted in ascending order.

After this is done, run `go test ./...` and  `golangci-lint run ./...` and make sure all reported errors are fixed
