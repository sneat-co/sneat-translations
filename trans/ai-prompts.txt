Run test TestTRANS from file "translations_test.go"
and add all missing translations reported by the test (escape all Unicode formatting characters)
to var TRANS only in the file "trans/translations.go". Use "en-UK" and "ru-RU" as base input for translations.

The locale ID keys in TRANS should be sorted in ascending order.

The structure of the TRANS variable is like this:

```go
var TRANS = map[string]map[string]string{
    "TRANSLATION_ID": map[string]string{
        "LOCALE_ID": "TRANSLATION_VALUE_UNICODE_FORMATTING_CHARS_ESCAPED"
    }
}
```

After this is done, run `go test ./...` and  `golangci-lint run ./...` and make sure all reported errors are fixed
